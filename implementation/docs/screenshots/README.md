# Screenshots

This folder is for Strategy Lab UI screenshots used in the project documentation and PRs.

How to use:

- Add a PNG or JPG screenshot, e.g. `strategy_lab_ui.png` showing the Strategy Lab result with the metadata expander open.
- Reference the file in the PR body or in docs using standard Markdown:

```markdown
![Strategy Lab UI](implementation/docs/screenshots/strategy_lab_ui.png)
```

Notes:
- Keep screenshots small (resize to ~1200px width) to avoid large repository assets.
- If you prefer not to commit the screenshot to the repo, drag & drop it directly into the PR description instead.
